Hi everyone, welcome to Armchair Investments, a website designed to be a space for those interested in finance to grow their knowledge and engage in deep conversations about the markets. Our hope with this site is to create engaging content that goes past basic trading topics. We hope to bring unique issues and topics to your attention. We look forward to hearing your feedback and any ideas you may have.

First, we will start with introductions. My name is Austin. I recently graduated from the University of Kansas, where I studied Economics and Mathematics. In my current role, I am a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. My work there is mainly focused on fixed income in international markets. My personal research is focused on market microstructure and macroeconomic finance. As must be stated in any regulatory position, the views expressed on this website do not reflect those of the Federal Reserve. I first fell in love with finance while reading about the mechanics of the 2008 financial crisis. A small market failure in a previously niche financial instrument grew into an almost complete collapse of the global credit system, which went from impacting boutique investment banks to main street.

Hello, My name is Miller Bath. As with Austin, I have graduated from the University of Kansas with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science. During the few months after COVID-19 shut down most peopleâ€™s activities, I decided to learn something new. Although I was familiar with markets and enjoyed learning about finance prior, staying at home gave me time to dive into topics I never had explored. Taking my initial interest in cryptocurrency and expanding it further, I have become familiar with what many other people my age should know for their own use. I firmly believe that if I can learn my way around the markets, you can as well.

We will soon publish our first blog post about how a young adult can and should save their limited money.

Thanks and we look forward to hearing from you soon,
The Armchair Team
